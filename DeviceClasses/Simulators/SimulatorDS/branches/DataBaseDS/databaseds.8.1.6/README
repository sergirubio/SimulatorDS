The original code belongs to Tiago Coutinho (ESRF), developer of PyTango

It has been patched and modified by Sergi Rubio (CELLS/ALBA) to allow stand-alone Tango simulations on newer linux (Suse 13.1) and Tango 8.2.1

Based on databaseds-8.1.6 release (although this device works well using newer PyTango, the simulations didn't worked using last PyDatabaseDS from PyPi, this is why I wrote this fork)

To run it as localhost:10000 use:

./DataBaseds 2 -ORBendPoint giop:tcp::11000

To launch it against a custom database file instead of tango_database.db

./DataBaseds -f test_alarms.db 2 -ORBendPoint giop:tcp::11000

Enjoy,
